## K-Nearest Neighbour Classification


K-nearest neighbour classification for test set from training set.
 For each row of the test set, the k nearest (in Euclidean distance) training set vectors are found, and the classification is decided by majority vote, with ties broken at random.
  If there are ties for the kth nearest vector, all candidates are included in the vote.

        <p> we used also  a classification with decision tree breaking down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed.
   The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes.

        <p> we used a Bayes Theorem for Naive Bayes Algorithm :with an assumption of independence among predictors.
    In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.</p>
